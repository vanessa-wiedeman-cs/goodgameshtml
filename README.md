- Project Goal:   

  - Summary: GoodGames is an application built for gamers, by gamers. It is a platform designed to let all gamers, casual or hardcore, share their views on upcoming games they're looking to play, and/or games they've already played. Users will either log in or sign up to the server in order to access the following information:

- Home Page:
  - Trending Tweets related to a video game the user is interested in
  - A "Featured" review which would include the latest edited review or preview from any user in the database
  - A Login form

- The Game Reviews tab on the navbar will direct the user to games they have already played and reviewed. From there, they will be able to access the following information:

- Game Title
  - Website related to the game by clicking on the game title
  - User-selected picture of the game, sourced by a URL
  - Review of the game
  - Reviewer/user name
  - "Edit" button which will let the user edit any game information
  - "Game Over!" button which will let the user delete any game information

 **The Game Previews tab will populate the same information as the Game Reviews tab, except it will have previews of games that haven't come out yet.

 Finally, the Reviews for Gamers by Gamers! dropdown will include an additional link to a stand-alone Login html file and a link to an html file that let's you add a new game to the database.
